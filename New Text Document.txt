Maybe I'm, maybe I am just as scared as you. It's alright, stay by my side. On the edge, on the edge of everything we know. It's alright, just don't look down. And I will hold on. I'll never let go.


So I tried to erase it but the ink bled right through. Almost drove myself crazy and these words led to you. And all these useless dreams of living alone like a dog-less bone. So come let me love you.

Remember the fine night there
Didn't I show I cared
I do, oh I do
Remember the white nights there
Didn't I show I cared
I do, oh I do
Wishes like a cold wind on my face
Wishes I could warm a frozen lake
